# bulls_and_cows

Bulls and Cows is an old code-breaking game. The computer makes a secret 4-digit number of which the player tries to guess. If the matching digits are in the right positions, they are "bulls"; if they are in different positions, then they are "cows". 

#### Example:
Secret number: 4271

Opponent's try: 1234

Answer: 1 bull and 2 cows. (The bull is "2", the cows are "4" and "1".)
